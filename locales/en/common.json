  "unitDescription": {
    "1": "The humble line infantry battalion is the basic unit of the army. The musket is its primary weapon, but it can also fend off cavalry or charge other infantry and artillery with the bayonet.",
    "2": "Reliable, well-rounded medium cavalry fit for harassment as well as prolonged fighting.",
    "3": "Affordable medium artillery with modest mobility and firepower, together with impressive canister fire.",
    "4": "Experienced, physically imposing soldiers with the ability to inspire friendly soldiers and terrify enemies. These elite units are exclusive to the most naturally gifted soldiers, which makes them much more expensive to field. Their intimidation and excellent melee characteristics are put to best use in a bayonet charge.",
    "7": "Elite line infantry trained with a special focus on rapid movement and marksmanship.",
    "11": "Light cavalry suited to attacking weak, damaged, and routing enemies. However, they will struggle against organized infantry and heavy cavalry. Use infantry and artillery to weaken the enemy first.",
    "5": "Elite light cavalry that use the lance to deliver devastating charges - a series of charges by multiple Lancer squadrons will swiftly rout any opposition. However, they're much less impressive in a drawn-out melee.",
    "8": "Formidable heavy cavalry with the strongest all-around melee combat effectiveness of any unit. However, it's still best to weaken the enemy with infantry or artillery before sending in your Cuirassiers.",
    "12": "The heaviest field gun available to the Napoleonic army; while these batteries are extremely expensive, their range and power are unmatched.",
    "6": "This artillery's speed and low cost make it suitable for supporting cavalry or advancing alongside your infantry line.",
    "9": "Light field howitzers with explosive shells and particularly lethal short-range canister fire - ideal for supporting your infantry line at medium to short range.",
    "10": "“To place any dependence upon militia is assuredly resting upon a broken staff.” - George Washington",
    "13": "“The Bashkir horse archers are undoubtedly the world's least dangerous troops.” - Baron Marbot, ignoring an arrow in his thigh",
    "14": "These shock troops are made up the tallest, strongest, and most imposing men of the line infantry. While they're generally more fearsome than average line troops, their most powerful option in combat is their devastating charge.",
    "15": "The lightest common field artillery of the Napoleonic Wars, with modest firepower and good mobility that make it a natural companion to the infantry.",
    "16": "Napoleonic battalions would detach these small companies of loose-order troops, such as Voltigeurs and Jaegers, to carry out a variety of duties. These troops would occupy terrain unsuitable to large infantry units, harass the enemy line, and screen the army to fend off enemy skirmishers.",
    "17": "While rifles of the Napoleonic era offer a much lower rate of fire than muskets, they compensated with excellent accuracy that helped win skirmishing duels, pick off enemy officers, and harass enemy artillery from a distance.",
    "18": "Napoleon favored the 6lb cannon for its balance of power and maneuverability; as the Napoleonic Wars wore on, he sought to replace the 4 and 8lb guns with as many 6 and 12lb guns as possible.",
    "19": "The Napoleonic rocket was an experimental, temperamental weapon with persistent accuracy issues. However, it boasts high maneuverability, a substantial explosive payload that's effective against terrain, and can deal excellent organizational damage at close range.",
    "24": "The 10-pounder licorne was a Russian artillery piece used in the Napoleonic Wars. It combined features of cannons and howitzers, allowing it to fire both solid shot and explosive shells, and was valued for its versatility and range.",
    "25": "The 18-pounder licorne was a Russian artillery piece of the Napoleonic Wars, combining the roles of cannon and howitzer. It could fire both solid shot and explosive shells, making it effective for long-range bombardment and battlefield support."
