    "Charging into a solid unit can be devastating to the attacker. Make sure to disorganize your target, disrupt it with fire, and/or charge from the flank for best results.",
    "The speed and stamina of Hussars make them vital for your cavalry force. Prey on skirmishers, artillery, and damaged units, but avoid cavalry fights.",
    "Muskets and artillery deal far more damage as you get closer.",
    "Howitzers fire at a high arc, which makes them much more effective than other artillery at attacking targets in forests and buildings.",
    "You can find a lot of useful info about your troops by selecting a unit, clicking Info (hotkey I) and examining the unit tabs.",
    "Routing units will demoralize nearby friendlies, tire themselves out, and may run off the map, Maintain reserves so you can cycle out disorganized units before they crack.",
    "Light artillery has considerable maneuverability even without Running; use Fire and Advance to move them forward with your infantry line.",
    "When you select a unit, you'll see its org radius in light blue. Enemies in this radius will lose organization, while friendlies will gain organization.",
    "Lancers are elite cavalry that focus on their devastating charge, but are inferior to the Cuirassier in a prolonged fight.",
    "Ranged attacks that hit an infantry unit in the flank will do far more damage.",
    "You can gain victory points by inflicting casualties or capturing the enemy objective with infantry. A large victory point lead slows the reorganization of enemy units and secures victory at the turn limit.",
    "Flank the enemy, don't get flanked.",
    "Submit your favorite replays through the Lines of Battle Discord server, and the dev team will highlight them on YouTube!",
    "If you have any questions about the game, the Lines of Battle Wiki, Reddit, and Discord server should be able to help.",
    "If you're enjoying Lines of Battle and want to help support the creator, join the Patreon! Every contribution helps.",
    "Did you know you can move your Big objective during the start-up phase? You can capture them with one infantry battalion in 20 turns, 20 battalions in one turn, etc. This process is very slow, but capturing enemy's Big objective will give you an instant win!",
    "The neutral objective is primarily a tiebreaker and doesn’t confer much advantage before the last turn. However, it also slightly increases the speed at which your ammo is replenished. It’s okay for the enemy to take it as long as you have a plan to take it back, but consider having some ammo in reserve.",
    "Select the order button to access commands like Withdrawal, Fire and Advance, and Shoot.",
    "All units have an org radius that boosts the organization and charge of nearby friendlies while hurting the enemy; stack this effect to obtain a tactical advantage, especially when using Guards, Grenadiers, and Cuirassiers.",
    "Leave your artillery a clear line of sight; don't maneuver your infantry in front of it.",
    "\"It is for the cavalry to follow up the victory and prevent the beaten enemy from rallying.\" - Napoleon Bonaparte",
    "\"To plan to reserve cavalry for the finish of the battle, is to have no conception of the power of combined infantry and cavalry charges, either for attack or for defense.\" - Napoleon Bonaparte",
    "\"Just attack.\" - Marechal Apeiro",
    "\"Where my dragons at?\" - Marechal SteelFlesher",
    "Stamina regain is very slow, but Running offers a major increase in speed. Be mindful of balancing aggressive deployment against the need for fresh reserves.",
    "”The art of war consists in bringing to bear with an inferior army a superiority of force at the point at which one attacks or is attacked.”-Napoleon Bonaparte",
    "”To look over a battlefield, to take in at the first instance the advantages and disadvantages is the great quality of a general.”-Chevalier de Folard",
    "”In a battle, as in a siege, the art consists in concentrating very heavy fire on a particular point… the one who has the ability to concentrate an unlooked for mass of artillery suddenly and unexpectedly on one of these points is sure to carry the day.” -Napoleon Bonaparte",
    "”Artillery is more essential to cavalry than to infantry, because cavalry has no fire for its defence, but depends on the sabre.”-Napoleon Bonaparte",
    "”The art of war is like everything else that is beautiful and simple. The simplest moves are the best.”-Napoleon Bonaparte",
    "“I never saw so many shocking bad hats in my life.”-The Duke of Wellington",
    "Skirmishers are extremely vulnerable to melee in the open; use them in terrain or escort them with cavalry.",
    "In the early game, try to Run your skirmishers into an advantageous position. Cavalry has less stamina than infantry; be mindful about using it at the right time.",
    "The game mechanic of stamina doesn't apply to artillery; always run it when traversing long distances.",
    "Each infantry formation has its own purpose. Use the Line for maximum firepower, the Column for rapid maneuvers and powerful charges, and the Square to repel cavalry charges.",
    "Infantry formed in a square can shoot in all directions and offers the best protection against cavalry charges. However, the square is virtually immobile and takes additional damage from fire.",
    "The Mass formation offers flexibility and relatively high maneuverability at the expense of mediocre combat stats."
