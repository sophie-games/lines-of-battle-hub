  "unitDescription": {
    "1": "The humble line infantry battalion is the basic unit of the army. The musket is its primary weapon, but it can also fend off cavalry or charge other infantry and artillery with the bayonet.",
    "2": "Dragoons were the single most common cavalry in Napoleon's army. They may lack the dash of hussars and the glamour of Cuirassiers, but these formidable medium cavalry should generally be the basis of your cavalry force.",
    "3": "Affordable medium artillery with very potent canister and good damage at range, but somewhat poor mobility.",
    "4": "Experienced, physically imposing soldiers that improve the performance of nearby troops through their presence alone. These elite units are exclusive to the most naturally gifted soldiers, which makes them much more expensive to field. They will fight through damage that would break any lesser unit.",
    "5": "Elite light cavalry that use the lance to deliver devastating charges - a series of charges by multiple Lancer squadrons will swiftly rout any opposition. However, they're much less impressive in a drawn-out melee.",
    "6": "This artillery's speed and low cost make it suitable for supporting cavalry or advancing alongside your infantry line.",
    "7": "Elite line infantry battalions trained with a special focus on rapid movement and marksmanship.",
    "8": "Formidable heavy cavalry with the strongest all-around melee combat effectiveness of any unit. Use Cuirassiers to dominate enemy cavalry, or mass them to break through the enemy front after softening it with artillery fire.",
    "9": "These light, mobile field howitzers throw 23lb shells that deal competent damage regardless of terrain or distance. At close range, their heavy canister volleys deliver some of the most destructive fire known to the Napoleonic Wars.",
    "10": "“To place any dependence upon militia is assuredly resting upon a broken staff.” - George Washington",
    "11": "These dashing light cavalry squadrons offer high speed and stamina, but will lose in a fight against infantry or heavier cavalry. Instead, use hussars to scout and terrorize vulnerable targets - skirmishers, cavalry, and disorganized or routing troops.",
    "12": "The heaviest field gun available to the Napoleonic army; while these batteries are extremely expensive, their range and power are unmatched.",
    "13": "“The Bashkir horse archers are undoubtedly the world's least dangerous troops.” - Baron Marbot, ignoring an arrow in his thigh",
    "14": "These shock troops are made up the tallest, strongest, and most imposing men of the line infantry. Keep your Grenadiers in good condition and commit them when the enemy begins to waver to break them utterly.",
    "15": "The lightest common field artillery of the Napoleonic Wars, with modest firepower and good mobility that make it a natural companion to the infantry.",
    "16": "Napoleonic battalions would detach these small companies of loose-order troops, such as Voltigeurs and Jaegers, to carry out a variety of duties. These troops would occupy terrain unsuitable to large infantry units, harass the enemy line, and screen the army to fend off enemy skirmishers.",
    "17": "While rifles of the Napoleonic era offer a much lower rate of fire than muskets, they compensated with excellent accuracy that helped win skirmishing duels, pick off enemy officers, and harass enemy artillery from a distance.",
    "18": "Napoleon favored the 6lb cannon for its balance of power and maneuverability; as the Napoleonic Wars wore on, he sought to replace the 4 and 8lb guns with as many 6 and 12lb guns as possible.",
    "19": "The Napoleonic rocket was an experimental, temperamental weapon with persistent accuracy issues. However, it boasts high maneuverability, and at close range it can deliver intense fire that deals little damage but has catastrophic effects on enemy morale.",
    "24": "The 10-pounder licorne was a gun-howitzer of the Russian army of the Napoleonic Wars. Its long-range explosive shells are well-suited to dealing with enemies in terrain, and its close-range canister is devastating. Use the medium-range round shot of the 10lber to decimate targets in the open.",
    "25": "The 18-pounder licorne is a heavy Russian gun howitzer with terrifying close-range canister, medium-range round shot that's highly effective against troops in the open, and long-range explosive shells that ignore the benefits of enemy defensive terrain."
