    "message": "Here, you can design custom armies that suit your own style and preferences. If you're new to Lines of Battle, stick with the default composition until you learn the basics; the default armies are highly competitive and consist of the most cost-effective, well-rounded units in the game.\n\nThe best armies typically consist of 60-75% infantry, 20-35% cavalry, and 10-15% artillery."

    "message": "An enemy force of roughly equal strength has marched to meet us on this battlefield.\n\nThere are three ways you can obtain victory:\n\n1. The complete destruction of the enemy force – rout every unit to win.\n2. Holding the field at the end of the day – inflict more casualties than the enemy or use your infantry battalions to seize neutral objectives to gain Victory Points. If you have a +10 Victory Point lead when the game ends, you win.\n3. Cutting the enemy lines of supply – use your infantry battalions to capture the large objective in the enemy deployment zone. This takes more than twice as long as capturing a small objective, but will end the game in your favor.\n\nBest of luck, General!"

  "routingUnits": {
    "title": "Routing Units",
    "message": "A unit has lost all cohesion and is now fleeing the front. If it can reach a safe distance from enemy forces, it will stop fleeing and rapidly regain organization – at 30% organization, it will rally and you will regain control of it. You can accelerate this process by placing friendly units such as cavalry nearby.\n\nTry to replace low-organization units in combat with fresh, well-organized reserves. It's much more efficient to reorganize a disorganized unit than to rally a broken one."
