# Lines of Battle Hub

## Overview

This project contains language files and scenarios used for Lines of Battle. Below is a guide to the folder structure and requirements for contributing or using the files.

## Folder Structure

### Locales

- The `locales` folder contains all language folders.
- Each file represents a specific language or locale, formatted as JSON.
- Example: `locales/en/common.json` for English, `locales/es/common.json` for Spanish, etc.

### Scenarios

- The `scenarios` folder contains all scenario files.
- Each scenario must include:
  - A JSON file describing the scenario (e.g., `scenario-name.json`).
  - An accompanying image file (e.g., `scenario-name.(png, jpg, or webp)`) to provide a visual representation of the scenario.
- Both the JSON and image files for a scenario must be uploaded together in their `scenarios` folder to ensure clarity and ease of use.

## Contribution Guidelines

- To add a new language, place the locale file in the `locales` folder and ensure it follows the existing format.
- To add a new scenario, upload both the JSON file and its corresponding image to the `scenarios` folder.
- Ensure file names are descriptive and consistent for easy identification.
